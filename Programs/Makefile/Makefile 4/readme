This application contains three files as
1. main.c
2. helper.c
3. header.h
we can compile this application as 
	gcc main.c helper.c -o final

After this command final named executable file gets created then we can runthis file as
	./final

To perform this above task we can create makefile and write the above command in that file as it is.
all is the first target in this makefile.
we can also add multiple target in this makefile but by defaut first target gets executed.
In this makefile compile is the second target which contains actual compilation command and all is the first
target which contains nothing. 
we can use command as make which run our makefile and does nothing because our first target is empty.
but we can fire this command as 
	make compile
which compile our program successfully.
