This application contains three files as
1. main.c
2. helper.c
3. header.h
we can compile this application as 
	gcc main.c helper.c -o final

After this command final named executable file gets created then we can runthis file as
	./final

To perform this above task we can create makefile and write the above command in that file as it is.
all is the first target in this makefile.

In this makefile we are creating multiple targets and its dependencies.
In this makefile first we create first .o file by using gcc command and then combine that all .o files.
